### Abstract

...


### This software accomplishes the following:

...

### What are the unique features of the software?

...

### What improvements have been made over existing similar software application?

...

### What problems are you trying to solve in the software?

...

### Does your work relate to current or future NASA (include reimbursable) work that has value to the conduct of aeronautical and space activities? If so, please explain:

Yes, the work is directly relevant to NASA Earth science missions, particularly ECOSTRESS and SBG.
The software provides the capability of producing high resolution visibile to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) images coincident to TIR instrument overpasses. This greatly improves ECOSTRESS's, and potentially SBG's, ability to estimate evapotranspiration. This capability potentially benefits all thermal remote sensing missions and evapotranspiration remote sensing projects. 

### What advantages does this software have over existing software?

...

### Are there any known commercial applications? What are they? What else is currently on the market that is similar?
